# Redux and React Udacity exercise

This repo is a code-along with the second project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

This project is a simple HTML Page with Redux scripts to add, view and remove To-Do and Goals. The point of this project is to understand the Redux fundamentals and implement its concepts.

You can just get started by viewing the HTML file in a browser.
