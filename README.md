# Redux and React Udacity exercise

This repo is a code-along with the second project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

This project is a simple HTML Page with React and Redux scripts that help in adding, viewing and removing To-Dos and Goals. The point of this project is to understand the Redux fundamentals, features and implement the same.

You can just get started by viewing the HTML file in a browser.

The project uses a fake API and a fake DB that will provide a set of details on refresh of the page and will not be actually storing the data to the DB.

## Contributing
